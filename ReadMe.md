## SimpleToDo
This is a simple todo "program".  
Code is pretty scuft but works got enough.  

Feels free to use this however you want.  

To create the database just run [creating query](https://github.com/ErikSchnittker/SimpleToDo/blob/master/db/database.sql)
.  
You might want to change the database name though.  
Than you will also need to change it in the [connection configuration](https://github.com/ErikSchnittker/SimpleToDo/blob/master/db/connection.php).
